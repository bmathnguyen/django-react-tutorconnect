## Getting Started

### Using PostgreSQL (USE_POSTGRES=1)

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already):
   - macOS: `brew install postgresql`
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install postgresql`

2. **Create the database** (replace username/dbname as needed):
   ```sh
   createdb -U postgres tutoring_db
   # or
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE tutoring_db;"
   ```

3. **Configure your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   USE_POSTGRES=1
   DB_NAME=tutoring_db
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see `psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL: database "tutoring_db" does not exist`, make sure you created the DB.
- If you see connection errors, check your `.env` and that PostgreSQL is running.
